# Motivation
This lab taught me the value of unit testing and how in depth the tests need to be in order to figure out what could be going wrong. 

# Problem
For this lab, I was given a black box environment where I needed to figure out what bugs were present in code that I couldn't see. Provided with only the .o file and the header file, I created tests in order to take my best guess at what bugs existed.

# Overall Thoughts
Overall I really enjoyed working on this lab. It was fun to think of new tests to create and seeing what the results were.
