I believe that isEmpty() function always returns true.

Because of this, the addBack function will check to see if the list is empty
before looking for the end of the list. Since isEmpty() always returns true,
it just adds to the front and doesn't bother looking for the back.

Same goes for removeBack and removeFront. Both of these functions check if the
list is empty and if so, it they will not remove.

However, these all could be seperate bugs. There's no way of me knowing if each function calls isEmpty or not. I'm just assuming that these functions utilize isEmpty and therefore, are not being executed properly.
