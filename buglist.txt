I believe that isEmpty() function always returns true. Because of this,
the addBack function will check to see if the list is empty before looking for
the end of the list. Since isEmpty() always returns true, it just adds to the
front and doesn't bother looking for the back to save on time. Same goes for
removeBack and removeFront. Both of these function check if the list is empty
and if so, it will not remove.
